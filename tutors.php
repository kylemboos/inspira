							Jaclyn Provencher
						</h4>
						<h5 style="font-weight: bold;">
							President
						</h5>
						<p>
							Jaclyn began studying Spanish when she was 12 and realized early on that it was her passion. She graduated from the University of California, Irvine  with BA’s in Spanish and Global Cultures with a minor in Latin American Studies. During the Fall Quarter of her last year at UC Irvine, she studied abroad in Santiago, Chile and lived with a home-stay, traveled throughout Latin America, and had an internship teaching English to elementary school children. <br/><br/>
							Jaclyn has been tutoring independently in Orange County throughout college and she has experience teaching a myriad of levels of Spanish. She has passed the Spanish Language AP exam, Spanish Literature AP exam, and the SAT Spanish subject test. She is also a member of the National Collegiate Hispanic Honor Society (Sigma Delta Pi) and she served as Vice President her third year at UCI and Co-President for her final year.<br/><br/>

					<p>
							During her final year of college after returning from Chile, Jaclyn had the idea of starting her own Spanish tutoring business in Orange County. After tutoring throughout her college career and only being able to help a limited amount of students due to her academic responsibilities, she realized that she could help far more students by finding qualified tutors to help others become bilingual. Jaclyn hopes that her business will communicate her passion for Spanish and fuel the <strong>inspira</strong>tion of her students to become bilingual. Her goal is not only to help students improve their grades, but also to encourage the study of languages while demonstrating the benefits of being bilingual. These "benefits" have allowed her to study and live in another country, travel and witness various cultures, and begin a business that she is truly passionate about.</br></br>
							When she isn't devoting her time to growing her business, Jaclyn volunteers her time coaching an Irvine Girls Softball team of 12-15 year olds. She has played softball since she was 8 and loves giving back to the community by helping girls become better athletes and individuals. Jaclyn also loves to travel and has visited countries such as Chile, Peru, Argentina, Mexico, Taiwan, China, and Australia. Through Inspira Spanish Tutoring she hopes to encourage students to travel and engage with other cultures as she has. </br></br>

							Textual Analysis and Interpretation, 20th Century Mexican Literature, Latin American Poetry, The Prose of Borges, Grammar and Composition,  Spanish Phonetics, Introduction to Spanish Linguistics, Advanced Conversation, Latin American Spanish

						Vanessa
					</h4>
					<h5 style="font-weight: bold;">
						Tutor
					</h5>
					<p>
						Vanessa was surrounded by Spanish at a very young age and has always had an interest in languages. She was raised in a bi-racial household; her mother being first generation in the United States from Mexico. It was the exposure from her mother's family that made Vanessa curious about the Spanish language. She understood spoken Spanish, but she began to learn how to formally read, write, and speak Spanish in school. Because of her fascination of the Spanish language, she began to take classes and begin to learn another language, Portuguese. <br/><br/>
						Vanessa spends her free time volunteering for events, specifically translating to spanish speakers. Vanessa also helps reinforce Spanish for young children that are enrolled in Spanish immersion schools. She ultimately wants to pursue a career in teaching Spanish and interpreting. Ultimately, Vanessa's INSPIRAtion was her "abuelo's" whom only spoke spanish, and hopes to give back to the community and inspire others as much as her "abuelo's" did. <br/><br/>

						Spanish 1-4, Spanish Grammar, Conversational Spanish, Latin American Films-Conducted in Spanish
